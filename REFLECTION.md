## Key Experiences and Challenges Faced During Development

During the development of this FastAPI calculator application, I encountered several significant challenges that enhanced my understanding of full-stack development. The most notable challenge was implementing comprehensive BREAD operations while maintaining proper user authentication and data isolation. Initially, ensuring that users could only access their own calculations required careful implementation of JWT token validation and database query filtering. The integration between the FastAPI backend and the frontend dashboard also presented complexities, particularly in handling asynchronous operations and managing state updates after CRUD operations. Additionally, implementing robust input validation both on the client and server sides required careful consideration of edge cases, especially for division by zero scenarios and ensuring minimum input requirements across all calculation types.

The development and deployment process using Docker and CI/CD pipelines introduced additional learning opportunities and challenges. Setting up the multi-container architecture with PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and the main application required careful configuration of networking, health checks, and environment variables. The GitHub Actions workflow implementation for automated testing, security scanning with Trivy, and Docker Hub deployment helped establish professional development practices. Testing presented its own challenges, particularly in writing comprehensive Playwright end-to-end tests that cover all BREAD operations while maintaining reliable test data isolation. These experiences significantly improved my skills in modern web development, containerization, and DevOps practices, providing valuable insights into production-ready application development.
